# Java-kuniv . 
This is Github, the best place on the internet to share codes. I will be posting here all the codes I write in Java classes I make each week.  

you will learn how you will get the updates of this folder later, but for now, just select clone or download, the green icon top right corner if this page.  

## Day 1  
Day 1 was an introductory tutorial where we introduced how Java works, we took 4 excercises where you can find them in Day1 folder.  
We talked about the following:  
    - File name should match class name  
    - Variables and data types in java  
    - Primitive types are with small letter `int`, `double`, `float`, `char`, `boolean`  
    - Other than that, we have Classes, which they all start with Capital letter `String`, `Scanner`  
    - syso -> `System.out.println("")` used to print text and variable values  
    - you can use `+` operator to split the string in multiple lines  
    ```Java
    System.out.println("hello" +   
                            "world!" +   
                            "my name is " + 
                            "Omar")  
    ```
    - Scanner methods, 
      - `.next()` takes one word  
      - `.nextLine()` takes a whole line  
      - `.nextInt()` takes the integer value of the written text  
      - `.nextDouble()` takes the double value of the written text  
      - ...  
    - Warnings and errors  
      - Errors are dangerous, and program won't run with a warning.   
      - Warnings are fine, most popular one is un used variable
